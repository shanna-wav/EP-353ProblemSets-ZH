# Zanne's Preproposal

## Ideas for my project:

I would like to model some basic psychoacoustic principles for my final project that computationally analyzes a human's listening perception. Some ideas of concepts to look into include pitch perception, loudness, masking, or localization. A more specific idea that I have is an application that identifies critical bandwidths of frequencies in cochlear filters to replicate first and second order beating. I am interested in these ideas because I would like to persue psychoacoustics at the graduate level, and this would be beneficial to my studies. 

## My Own Questions:

How can I gauge what is too much or too little in a project? Does this or any element of this sound like a reasonable project?
