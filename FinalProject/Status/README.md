#### Your name

Zanne Hanna

#### Project title

Auditory Analysis by Critical Bandwidth

***

#### What have you done for your project so far?

I have built a DFT algorith for my project, which works with a simple sine wave. I have developed the DFT algorith into the FFT algorithm, and I have successfully compiled the FFT with a simple sine wave.

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

The last element of my project is organizing the results of the FFT into the correct critical bandwidth "barks". 

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

I struggled with building my DFT algorithm because it compiled really slowly. The FFT works fine though, so I feel okay with that.
