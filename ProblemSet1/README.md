### Purpose

The purpose of this problem set was to familiarize myself with GitHub and the syntax of Markdown. 

### Description

For Problem Set 1.1, I reviewed the methods and terminology that are used in Github, including commits, pull and push, and branches. The readings helped me to understand this version control software. 

For problem Set 1.2, I followed the notes I took in class and referenced the Markdown Cheatsheet on Github so that I coould correctly size the headers and use lists to ensure the correct documentation of this file. 

### Build and Run Commands
This problem set did not require any build and run commands. 

### Acknolwedgement 

I used the [Markdown Cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) to help me with Problem Set 1.2.
